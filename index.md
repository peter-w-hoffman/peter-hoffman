I am a first-year PhD student at MIT advised by Professor Pablo Parrilo and Professor Gabriele Farina. I am interested problems related to diffusion models, optimization, and deep learning. 

Previously, I completed an undergratuate in Mathematics also at MIT where I worked with Professor Pablo Parrilo on optimization solutions to the Blotto Game.
