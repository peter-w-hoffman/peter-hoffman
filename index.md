I am a first-year PhD student at MIT advised by Professor Pablo Parrilo and Professor Gabriele Farina. I am interested problems at the intersection of machine learning and optimization, particularly those related to the theory of diffusion models and sampling. 


Previously, I completed an undergratuate in Mathematics also at MIT where I worked with Professor Pablo Parrilo on optimization solutions to the Blotto Game.
